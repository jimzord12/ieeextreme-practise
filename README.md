# What is this Repository about?

This repository contains solutions for Conding Challenges from [CS Academy](https://csacademy.com/ieeextreme-practice). The solutions are implemented in Typescript and each soluting contains simple Unit Tests and Benchmarks (Execution Speed + Memory Usage).

# How to use this Repository

1. You will need to install the `tsx` compiler to run the solutions. This tool allows you to run Typescript files directly (without compiling them to JS). You can install it by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g tsx
```

2. Next, you should download and install the dependencies for this project. Your terminal must need to navigated to where the package.json file is located. To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

3. Finally, you should be able to run the solutions by running the following command (e.g. tsx ./minimum-permutation.ts):

```bash
tsx <path-to-solution-file>.ts
```

4. To run the tests, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
